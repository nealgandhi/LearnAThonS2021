Repository for the Freetail Hacker Learn-A-Thon Spring2021

## Inspiration
As students, especially today, we are more online focused with our learning. Our classes and homework happen to be all online, so why not have our notes also be online? Lineup does just that, with a simple text editor offered online, next to your lecture and homework tabs.

---

## What it does
Lineup lets the user sign in and link their account to the database, which allows them to access their notes anytime, anywhere.

---

## How we built it
We built it using Django, Python's webapp framework, and Bulma, a HTML framework that we used for design.

---

## Challenges we ran into
We ran into trouble getting our user authentication working, and integrate it with the database. We also ran into trouble while trying to hoist our project, and we had to forego that option for timesake.

---

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Creating a fully functional web app with Django for the first time was the biggest accomplishment that we found. Learning how to work with Django and creating a website that not only is function, but also as some style to it was the highlight of the weekend.

---

## What's next for Lineup
What's next is we properly hoist and host our project through a provider and add in more features such as, note sharing through shareable urls, an easy to understand to-do list, and features to add pictures. We hope to also include support for markdown, a lightweight markup language, that lets users format their text in multiple different ways.
